# Intro to Backend
* Backend consists of application,server,and database

# Intro to Frameworks
* Programmers, the best of whom are pretty lazy folk (in a good way), got tired of having to write the same code over and over and over again just to cover the basic tasks that they wanted their applications to perform.
* So they batched that recycled code together and called it a framework.
* They tend to force you to organize your files and code in a way that keeps it highly modular and really clean.
*  Web frameworks help us achieve structure in our applications, and they give us additional features we can add to them without too much extra work. Frameworks give us a place to start so that we can focus on features rather than configuration details
